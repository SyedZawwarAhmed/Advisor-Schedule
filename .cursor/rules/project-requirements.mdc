These are the final project requirements
A Calendly-like scheduling tool for advisors to meet with their clients.

- I can log in with Google to the app and it pulls in my calendars events
- I can connect more Google accounts to pull in more calendars’ events
- I can connect my Hubspot CRM account (Oauth apps and a free testing account are self-serve)
- I can create scheduling windows where I can add rows and each row has a start hour, end hour, and a weekday
- I can create scheduling links. each link has the following settings:
    - How many times it can be used to schedule (optional to the user)
    - An expiration date (optional to the user)
    - A form where I can configure any number of questions I want to ask when people schedule
    - The length of the meeting in minutes
    - The maximum number of days in advance that can be scheduled
- When a user visits a scheduling link:
    - They get an unauthenticated page that shows times available to schedule
    - The client can pick an available time and then:
        - It asks for their email address
        - It asks for their LinkedIn username/url
        - The custom questions appear with text areas where I can type in answers
- After they schedule:
    - I get an email telling me that someone scheduled:
    - Find a contact in Hubspot that matches the email of the person who scheduled
        - If no contact is found in Hubspot, then scrape their linkedin page for content (using AI if you want to)
        - The answer to their question should be augmented using AI with any context from Hubspot or LinkedIn related to their answer. So if I ask “What concerns do you have” and they answer “My daughters wedding is going to be expensive” and Hubspot has a note attached to the contact including something like: “They are concerned about paying for their daughters college” the email might say:
            
            > My daughters wedding is going to be expensive
            
            Context: They said last time they were concerned about paying for her college
            > 
    - I can view the meeting in the app with the answers and the augmented note or linkedin summary
